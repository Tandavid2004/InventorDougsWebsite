                            Going once… Going twice… SOLD! After 18 years of thrilling crowds, Robosaurus, the legendary fire-breathing, 
                            car-eating, 58,000-pound transforming monster, was auctioned off at the Barrett-Jackson Auction in Scottsdale, 
                            Arizona, on January 19, 2008.

                            This mechanical marvel was the brainchild of Doug Malewicki, who secured two U.S. patents for his invention. 
                            He founded Monster Robots, Inc., leading all aspects of its creation—from securing investors and sponsors to 
                            designing the structural engineering, hydraulics, electronics, and control systems. Built in just 1.5 years, 
                            Robosaurus has been an unstoppable force in live entertainment since 1990.
